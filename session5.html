💬 Warm-up (10 minutes)

Ask:

“Who remembers how our website looked last week?”

“Do you think we can make it colorful and cool?”

“What colors do you want for your page?”

Show an example before and after adding CSS:
🖥️ Plain HTML page → 🎨 Styled CSS page

Kids will instantly get excited to start styling!

🧩 Step-by-Step Lesson
🎨 Part 1: What is CSS? (15 minutes)

Explain:

“HTML builds the structure — like the walls of a house.
CSS is the paint, decorations, and style!”

Show the structure of a CSS rule:

selector {
  property: value;
}


Example:

h1 {
  color: blue;
}


💡 Explain:

h1 → tells the browser what to style (selector).

color → what you want to change (property).

blue → how you want to change it (value).

🎨 Part 2: Internal CSS (20 minutes)

Show how to add a <style> section inside the <head>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Personal Website</title>
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: lightyellow;
      }

      h1 {
        color: darkblue;
        font-family: Arial;
      }

      p {
        color: darkgreen;
        font-size: 18px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kareem. I love coding and learning new things!</p>
  </body>
</html>


💬 Discuss:

background-color changes the whole page color.

color changes text color.

font-family changes the font.

font-size changes how big the text is.

🧠 Fun Exercise:

“Change the background to your favorite color and make the text readable.”

Encourage creativity but remind them:

“Bright text on bright backgrounds is hard to read!”

🌈 Part 3: Styling Multiple Elements (15 minutes)

Show how they can style lists, links, and sections:

ul {
  color: purple;
}

a {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: none;
}

section {
  background-color: #f0f8ff;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid #ccc;
}


💡 Explain:

padding adds space inside an element.

border adds a line around an element.

#f0f8ff is a hex color code (advanced concept — just introduce it lightly).

🧠 Mini Activity:

“Add borders to your sections and make each section have a different background color!”

🧱 Part 4: Inline vs Internal vs External CSS (10 minutes)

Show the three ways to use CSS:

Inline CSS (inside a tag)

<h1 style="color:red;">Hello</h1>


➤ Use only for quick changes.

Internal CSS (inside <style>)

<style> p { color: blue; } </style>


➤ Best for small projects.

External CSS (in another file)

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">


➤ Best for big projects (will be used later in Week 6).

💪 Part 5: Mini Project — “My Styled Website” (15 minutes)

Goal: Add CSS to their “Personal Website” from Week 4.

✅ Requirements:

Change the background color of the page.

Make the main heading (h1) a fun color.

Style paragraphs with a readable font.

Give each section a border and some padding.

Change link colors in the <nav> bar.

Example:

body {
  background-color: #fef9e7;
  font-family: "Comic Sans MS";
}

header {
  background-color: #aed6f1;
  padding: 10px;
}

nav a {
  color: darkblue;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

footer {
  background-color: #d5f5e3;
  padding: 5px;
  text-align: center;
}


Encourage kids to test colors using color names (red, green, lightblue) or hex codes (optional).

🎉 Show & Tell (5 minutes)

Have a “Website Parade” where 3–4 students show:

Their chosen color combinations.

Cool fonts or section styles.

Ask:

“What colors did you pick and why?”

“Who made their website easy to read?”

Reward creativity with fun badges like 🌈 “Color Master” or 🎨 “Design Star”.

🏡 Homework

Add at least 3 new CSS rules (e.g., style lists, links, or headers).

Try two different background colors and pick their favorite one.

Save the project as my_styled_website.html.

✅ Assessment & Success Criteria
Skill	What to Check	Success
Added CSS correctly	<style> inside <head>	✅
Changed text colors	Used color: property	✅
Changed background	Used background-color:	✅
Styled multiple elements	Headers, paragraphs, lists	✅
Creativity	Fun colors and readable design	🌟 Bonus
⚠️ Common Mistakes
Mistake	What Happens	Fix
Missing curly braces {}	CSS stops working	Always use { property: value; }
Forgetting ; at end of line	Only first rule works	Add semicolons after each rule
Writing CSS inside <body>	Doesn’t apply	Write it inside <head>
Dark text on dark background	Hard to read	Choose high contrast colors
🎯 Bonus Challenge (for fast learners)

Add a hover effect for links:

a:hover {
  color: orange;
}


Make the footer text smaller:

footer {
  font-size: 14px;
}


Use a Google Font (introduce briefly):

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comic+Neue&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<style>
  body { font-family: 'Comic Neue', cursive; }
</style>

🧰 Teacher Tips

Bring color charts or let students explore colorpicker.me
 (if online).

Let students experiment — don’t restrict their color choices unless text is unreadable.

Encourage sharing ideas like “Who found the nicest background?”

If a student’s CSS breaks, help debug by checking for {}, ;, or where <style> is placed.

Preview next week: “Next time, we’ll learn how to make our websites look organized — with boxes, alignment, and spacing!”
